The hero starts the game with 30 health points. The game ends when the hero has 0 or less health points.
At the beginning of the game the player has a deck of 30 cards. A hand consists of a maximum of 9 cards.
If the number of cards increases, then each new card must be changed with one in a hand or be discarded.

If a player loses all 30 cards from the deck, the hero receives one damage each time the player must draw one card from the deck.
Even if a player already has a hand of 9 cards, but needs one more card and the deck is empty, the hero will still receive one damage.

The player starts the game with 5 cards in hand. On his first turn, he can replace any number of cards in his hand once.
In subsequent rounds there is no such opportunity.Almost every card has its own abilities, which are applied as soon as
the card is placed on the field from your hand. Also, to issue a card, you need to pay a certain price indicated on it.

Technical points:
1)To select your card, click on it
2)To place a card from your hand onto the field - select a card from your hand and click on the battlefield
3)To attack an opponent's card - already having the selected card on the battlefield select an enemy card on the battlefield
4)To attack the enemy - already having a selected card on the battlefield, select the enemy icon
5)Replace cards - click on the "change creatures" button and enter the indexes of the cards you want to change
6)End your turn - click on the "end turn" button

Small points:
1)Each card can only attack once per year
2)Each turn the amount of mana increases by 1, up to 10
3)Characters with a "T" in their name have a taunt, which means that while they are in poly,
enemy cards cannot attack other cards or the character themselves.
